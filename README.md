# gallerize

This is a fork of "gallery_shell" : https://github.com/Cyclenerd/gallery_shell

Gallerize is a bash script that automatically generates a static gallery of your photos and videos !

It basically has a the same features as "Gallery_shell" but unlike gallery_shell, this script will also create pages and thumbnails for your video files.

It also improves the design of the generated HTML.

Before using you need to install : 

sudo apt install imagemagick jhead ffmpeg
